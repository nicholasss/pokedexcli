# Boot.dev Guided Project
This project, while guided, required plenty of reasearch and the use of additional resources.

## Resources:
### JSON to Golang converter
https://mholt.github.io/json-to-go/

I used this converter in order to better understand and implement the json tags used in Go. I was succsessful in not copy/pasting anything from the site directly, but rather to understand *why* the structure and tags were laid out in this way.

### PokeAPI Docs
https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

I used the linked docs in order to understand what would be returned from the various endpoints, as well providing URLs to map cached data to.

### go doc
`$ go doc xyz`

I used the built-in `go doc` as reference in a secondary terminal in order to either confirm or to look up information on various standard library packages.
